# Supabase Security Audit Report - IRC Application

**Date:** September 19, 2025  
**Project:** IRC Next Application  
**Database:** Supabase PostgreSQL  
**Project ID:** pigrdhzlhvvigkbjlmfi  

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive security audit examined the Supabase database configuration, Row Level Security (RLS) policies, authentication mechanisms, and application security practices for the IRC application. While the application has a solid foundation with RLS enabled on all tables and comprehensive policies, several critical security vulnerabilities were identified that require immediate attention.

## Critical Findings

### üî¥ CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES

1. **Hardcoded Service Role Key in Source Code**
   - **Location:** `/app/api/delete-account/route.ts:6`
   - **Issue:** Service role key is hardcoded directly in the source file
   - **Risk:** Complete database access if source code is compromised
   - **Recommendation:** Use environment variables exclusively

2. **API Endpoint Authorization Bypass**
   - **Location:** `/app/api/ban/route.ts`
   - **Issue:** No authentication/authorization checks before performing admin actions
   - **Risk:** Anyone can ban users by calling the API directly
   - **Recommendation:** Implement proper authentication and admin privilege verification

3. **Overprivileged Database Permissions**
   - **Issue:** Anonymous and authenticated roles have ALL permissions (DELETE, INSERT, UPDATE, TRUNCATE, TRIGGER) on all tables
   - **Risk:** RLS policies are the only protection; if bypassed, complete data loss possible
   - **Recommendation:** Implement principle of least privilege for database roles

### üü° HIGH RISK FINDINGS

4. **Sensitive Data in Auth Schema**
   - **Tables:** `auth.users` contains encrypted_password, tokens, email data
   - **Issue:** No additional encryption or data masking for highly sensitive fields
   - **Risk:** Data breach if database is compromised

5. **Insufficient Input Validation**
   - **Issue:** Limited check constraints beyond NOT NULL constraints
   - **Risk:** Data integrity issues and potential injection attacks
   - **Current Constraints:** Only basic NOT NULL validations present

6. **Admin Privilege Escalation Risk**
   - **Issue:** Admin functions in `/lib/admin.ts` don't verify that the requesting user has sufficient privileges
   - **Risk:** Privilege escalation if authentication is bypassed

## Detailed Security Analysis

### Row Level Security (RLS) Status

‚úÖ **GOOD:** All tables have RLS enabled:
- admin_logs: ‚úì ENABLED
- admin_reports: ‚úì ENABLED  
- channel_bans: ‚úì ENABLED
- channel_categories: ‚úì ENABLED
- channel_members: ‚úì ENABLED
- channel_roles: ‚úì ENABLED
- channels: ‚úì ENABLED
- mentions: ‚úì ENABLED
- messages: ‚úì ENABLED
- site_bans: ‚úì ENABLED
- users: ‚úì ENABLED

### RLS Policy Analysis

**Well-Implemented Policies:**
- Admin tables properly restrict access to site admins/super admins
- Channel-specific permissions correctly enforce membership requirements
- User profile access properly limited to self or authenticated users
- Message access requires channel membership with admin override

**Policy Concerns:**
- Some policies allow broad access with `auth.uid() IS NOT NULL`
- Update policies on channel_members allow any authenticated user to modify records
- Channel creation policies have loose restrictions

### Authentication & Authorization

**Current Implementation:**
- Uses Supabase Auth with JWT tokens
- Client-side authentication state management
- Admin privileges stored in user table (is_super_admin, is_site_admin, is_site_moderator)

**Security Issues:**
- API routes don't consistently verify authentication
- Admin actions performed without server-side privilege verification
- Session management relies entirely on client-side code

### Database Schema Security

**Foreign Key Relationships:** ‚úÖ Well-implemented with proper cascade relationships

**Sensitive Data Handling:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Email addresses stored in plain text
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No additional encryption for sensitive user data
- ‚úÖ No passwords stored in application tables (handled by auth schema)

**Data Validation:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Only basic NOT NULL constraints
- ‚ùå No format validation for emails, usernames, etc.
- ‚ùå No length limits beyond column types

### API Security

**Current Issues:**
1. **Missing Authentication Checks:** Several API routes don't verify user authentication
2. **Insufficient Authorization:** Admin actions don't verify user privileges
3. **Input Validation:** Limited server-side input validation
4. **Error Handling:** Some endpoints leak sensitive error information

## 2025 Security Best Practices Compliance

### ‚ùå FAILING PRACTICES

1. **Zero Trust Architecture:** App relies heavily on client-side authentication
2. **Defense in Depth:** Single point of failure at RLS policy level
3. **Least Privilege:** Database roles have excessive permissions
4. **Input Validation:** Insufficient server-side validation
5. **Secrets Management:** Hardcoded credentials in source code

### ‚úÖ COMPLIANT PRACTICES

1. **Encryption in Transit:** HTTPS enforced by Supabase
2. **Audit Logging:** Admin actions are logged
3. **Database Security:** RLS policies implemented
4. **Authentication:** Modern JWT-based authentication

## Recommendations for Remediation

### Immediate Actions (Fix within 24 hours)

1. **Remove hardcoded credentials** from source code
2. **Add authentication checks** to all API routes
3. **Implement admin privilege verification** in API endpoints
4. **Review and restrict database role permissions**

### Short-term Actions (Fix within 1 week)

1. **Add input validation** with schema validation libraries
2. **Implement rate limiting** on API endpoints
3. **Add comprehensive error handling** without information leakage
4. **Add data validation constraints** to database schema
5. **Implement proper session management**

### Long-term Actions (Fix within 1 month)

1. **Implement defense-in-depth security layers**
2. **Add data encryption for sensitive fields**
3. **Implement comprehensive security monitoring**
4. **Add automated security testing**
5. **Regular security audits and penetration testing**

## Security Score

**Overall Security Score: 4/10**

- **Authentication:** 6/10 (Good foundation, poor implementation)
- **Authorization:** 3/10 (Major gaps in API security)
- **Data Protection:** 5/10 (RLS good, but sensitive data concerns)
- **Infrastructure Security:** 7/10 (Supabase provides good baseline)
- **Application Security:** 2/10 (Critical vulnerabilities in API layer)

## Conclusion

While the IRC application has a solid foundation with RLS policies and proper database relationships, critical security vulnerabilities in the API layer and authentication implementation pose significant risks. The hardcoded service role key and lack of API authentication represent immediate threats that could lead to complete system compromise.

**Priority 1:** Fix credential management and API authentication  
**Priority 2:** Implement proper input validation and error handling  
**Priority 3:** Add defense-in-depth security measures  

This application should not be deployed to production until the critical vulnerabilities are addressed.
